This is a few discord bots i made when i was bored to organise my team for a Virtual Reality Master League (VRML) game called Breachers VR.

The F3 Bot included a web REST API that made my bot send a message into the designated channel with a discord embed vote (for avalibility)

The ivi bot is my current bot, not updating this repo for that version.

Only reason being: i have coded the same bot in 3 different programming languages, Python, Javascript and now TypeScript implementing something new eacht time.

As you can tell, im extremely bored so i just made these in my spare time for fun
