# VRML Team Discord Bots for Breachers VR

A collection of Discord bots I developed to organize and coordinate my team for the VRML (Virtual Reality Master League) game **Breachers VR**. These bots were created as side projects in my spare time, with each iteration exploring a different programming language and adding unique features.

## 🚀 Project Overview

1. **F3 Bot**
    - Built with: **Javascript** (previously in Python)
    - Purpose: Organize team availability for VRML matches.
    - Features:
      - **REST API**: Enables external commands to interact with Discord.
      - **Availability Voting**: Uses old embeds (one for each day of the week) in a specified channel that allows team members to vote on their availability.
      - + More
    - Status: Archived, no further updates planned.

2. **IVI Bot**
    - Built with: **Javascript** (previously F3 Bot)
    - Purpose: Current bot in active use with new functionalities added over each version.
    - Evolution: 
      - F3 Bot → IVI Bot
      - Implemented unique features and improvements in each version for better performance and functionality.
      - Added the same avalibility feature, without there needing to be one for each day of the week constantly (create one on / command, with an auto generated custom id) which automatically deletes itself after scheduled time has passed
      - 
    - Status: Archived, no further updates planned.

## 💻 Languages Explored
These bots were developed multiple times across different programming languages, adding new layers of functionality and performance improvements in each iteration:
- **Python**
- **JavaScript**
- **TypeScript**

## ❗ Note
This repository currently holds only the earlier versions of the bot (Javascript, not python because i lost it). The latest version of IVI Bot in TypeScript is not included in this repository.

## 📜 About
These bots were a product of my free time and curiosity about bot development. They also served as a playground to learn and experiment with **REST APIs**, **Discord Embeds**, and multi-language bot development. 

> **Why so many versions?**  
> I enjoy experimenting with different programming languages and learning new techniques. Each iteration was built to test new ideas and features, so even though I only needed one bot, it’s been fun to build, improve, and re-build them.

## 🤖 Getting Started

To set up the bots:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the setup instructions in the respective bot directories (`F3-Bot` for the Old version, `IVI-Bot` for JavaScript better, new version).
3. Configure the bot token and create a file for the necessary settings named: `global_ids.json`
